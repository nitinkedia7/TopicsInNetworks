# How to run
1. Compile using ```g++ virtualCircuit.cpp```
2. Run the executable ```./a.out NSFNET/top14.txt NSFNET/NSFNET_100.txt hop 0```

# Arguments of the executable
The format is ```./a.out topology_file connections_file hop|dist 0|1```.
Three files ```routingTable.txt```, ```forwardingTable.txt```, ```pathsTable.txt``` will be generated in the output/
folder. Any previous file of same name will be overwritten.

# Sample Input/Output files
Two sample sets have been provided:
1. NSFNET/ generated by ```./a.out NSFNET/top14.txt NSFNET/NSFNET_100.txt hop 0```
2. ARPANET/ generated by ```./a.out ARPANET/top24.txt ARPANET/ARPANET_100.txt dist 1```

# Assumptions
1. In case of flag "dist", the path cost has been taken as the sum of delays along it as actual distance metric is not available. Also, delay is proportional to distance.
2. In forwarding table, the entry node for a virtual circuit doesn't have an incoming port or vcid. So, we have used -1 for these cases.
Similarly, no outgoing port or vcid exists for the destination node.
